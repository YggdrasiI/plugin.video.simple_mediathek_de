====  Kodi plugin for MediathekView ====

Dependencies:
  cmake, zip, gcc

Build:
  1. Clone this repository.
  2. Build native binary with 'make native'.
     This will also compile libbrotli (compression library)
  3. Build addon archive with 'make addon'
     This should create 'plugin.video.simple_mediathek_de.zip'.

  A build version can also be found at
  https://forum.mediathekview.de/topic/193/mediatheken-plugin-fÃ¼r-kodi/1

Installation:
  Variant A). Open Addon-Browser in Kodi and select 'Install from zip file'/'Aus ZIP-Datei installieren'.
     
    Note for  Kodi 17.0 (Krypton) and above:
      You had to allow addons from unknown sources in Preferences>System>Addons

  Variant B)  
    Unzip the addon archive into '.kodi/addons/.' and refresh the add-on list (or restart Kodi)
    The position of the .kodi folder depends on your system/setup.
    Default position on OpenELEC/LibreELEC: /storage/.kodi
    Default position on OSMC: /home/osmc/.kodi

    I.e.
      cd $HOME/.kodi/addons
      [...]
      unzip plugin.video.simple_mediathek.zip
      kodi-send -a "UpdateLocalAddons"
